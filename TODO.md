### Timeseries

1. 	Select 3 'representative' timeseries showing 3 behaviors by sampling aspects of behavior distribution; e.g., fast versus slow transitions --> 1) calculate variance; 2) if, say, normally distributed, get the timeseries closest to the median in the left 16%, another closest to the median in the right 16%, and the timeseries closest to the median in the 68%. --> or basically, use MVA to extract timeseries
